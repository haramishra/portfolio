                <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I sleep till 2pm. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
                <p className="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi, thriller and drama genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
